# An Opulent Voice MSK Modem for the ADALM-Pluto SDR Platform

Keywords: #MSK #SDR #Pluto #Opulent-Voice

This is a Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) modem for [Opulent Voice](#) (OPV) targeted to Analog Devices [ADALM-Pluto](https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/users/intro) SDR Platform. This repository provides a top-level design to be included in Pluto's AMD/Xilinx Zync7010 SoC. The modem and supporting functions are included from ORIs RTL library, and can be used in any FPGA development as well as non-OPV protocols. This repository can serve as a starting point/guide for targeting the MSK modem to other FPGA based SDR platforms.

The following ORI library components are used as submodules to this repository:

1. [msk_modulator](#)
2. [msk_demodulator](#)
3. [nco](#)
4. [pi_controller](#)
5. [prbs](#)
