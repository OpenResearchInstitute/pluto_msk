# An Opulent Voice MSK Modem for the ADALM-Pluto SDR Platform

Keywords: #MSK #SDR #Pluto #Opulent-Voice

This is a Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) modem for [Opulent Voice](https://www.openresearch.institute/2022/07/30/opulent-voice-digital-voice-and-data-protocol-update/) (OPV) targeted to Analog Devices [ADALM-Pluto](https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/users/intro) SDR Platform. This repository provides a top-level design to be included in Pluto's [AMD Zync Z-7010 SoC](https://www.amd.com/en/products/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/soc/zynq-7000.html). The modem and supporting functions are included from ORI's RTL library, and can be used in any FPGA development as well as non-OPV protocols. This repository can serve as a starting point/guide for targeting the MSK modem to other FPGA based SDR platforms.

The following ORI library components are used as submodules to this repository:

1. [msk_modulator](https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/msk_modulator)
2. [msk_demodulator](https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/msk_demodulator)
3. [nco](https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/nco)
4. [pi_controller](https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/pi_controller)
5. [prbs](https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/prbs)

## Building
In oder to build fpga bitstream, you need to install first Vivado. Recommended version is 2022.2. In this documentation vivado installtion path is assumed to be /opt/Xilinx/Vivado. If it is on an other directory, change the path (for example /tools/Xilinx/Vivado on keroppi) 
### First, clone this repo with all submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/pluto_msk
### building bitstream only
1. cd pluto_msk/projects/pluto/
2. source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2022.2/settings64.sh
3. make

For reference, on the chococat VM, the main branch takes:

## Development Quickstart

Here is a set of instructions for getting this minimum shift keying (MSK) transceiver implementation to work on a PLUTO SDR. 

Clone this pluto_msk repository.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/pluto_msk.git
```

The repository should clone to the latest stable PLUTO firmware release commit. Here is an example of how to change to another branch of the hdl reference design. hdl_2022_r2 was used for VHDL development. Don't change branches of hdl unless you have to.

```
/pluto_msk/hdl$ git checkout hdl_2022_r2 
Previous HEAD position was 1978df298 axi_dac_interpolate: Improve the ctrl logic
branch 'hdl_2022_r2' set up to track 'origin/hdl_2022_r2'.
Switched to a new branch 'hdl_2022_r2'
```

If you are working on ORI virtual machine, then source the version of Vivado needed as follows. 

```$ source /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2022.2/settings.sh```

You can check which version of Vivado is currently being used as follows. 

```
$ which vivado
/tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2022.2/bin/vivado
```
Change directories to the PLUTO project directory and run make. 

```
/hdl/projects/pluto$ make
```
A useful log file for information, warnings, and errors is pluto_vivado.log

This repository is organized as an out of tree module.

Key lines in system_bd.tcl are:

https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/pluto_msk/blob/942aa516f8cc30af73a5a0c9ce3f8266012989e8/projects/pluto/system_bd.tcl#L7-19

```
set_property ip_repo_paths [list $ad_hdl_dir/library ../../library]  [current_fileset]
update_ip_catalog
```
The ip_repo_paths property lets us create a custom IP catalog for use with Vivado. It defines the path to one or more directories containing user-defined intellectual property (IP), like our blocks. The specified directories, and any sub-directories, are searched for files to add to the Vivado IP catalog. The property is assigned to the current fileset of the current project. 

ip_repo_paths will look for a <component>.xml file, where <component> is the name of the IP to add to the catalog. This XML file lists the files that define the module. Subdirectories are searched through. We don't have to list out each individual module's <component>.xml.

Where does our component.xml file come from? It's create by the msk_top_ip.tcl file. A version can be found here:
https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/pluto_msk/blob/main/library/msk_top_ip.tcl

Setting the ip_repo_paths property needs to be followed by update_ip_catalog. 

Example syntax:

```
set_property IP_REPO_PATHS {c:/Data/Designs C:/myIP} [current_fileset]
update_ip_catalog
```

## Theory of Operation

### Modulated Waveform

Minimum-Shift-Keying (MSK) can be described as a combination of Frequency-Shift-Keying (FSK) and Offset-QPSK (OQPSK) modulations. FSK generally sends 1-bit per symbol as either a _mark_ or _space_ (represented by two frequencies $F_1$ and $F_2$, respectively) for each bit transmitted.

MSK transmits 2-bits per symbol, as does does OQPSK, and the bits are offset in time by one bit period, also the same as OQPSK. While MSK uses two frequencies like FSK, the phase of the two frequecies is modulated similarly to OQPSK, such that there are 4 distinct phase combinations for each symbol. 

The main difference between MSK and OQPSK is that MSK is a continuous phase modulation (CPM) meaning there are no phase discontinuties in the time domain waveform. This differs from QQPSK. Since MSK has no phase discontinuties, it is more spectrally efficient than FSK and most other 2-ary modulations.

MSK modulation can be expressed mathmatically in several ways, but the most interesting and intuitive form is:

$s(t) = I(t)cos\Big(\frac{2\pi F_b t}{4}\Big)cos(2\pi F_c t) + Q(t)sin\Big(\frac{2\pi F_b t}{4}\Big)sin(2\pi F_c t)$

where I(t) and Q(t) are elements of the set {-1,1}, and are offset by one bit period.

![Offset Bit Timing](docs/bit-offset-timing.png)

In this expression we can see that I and Q samples are each modulating two sinusoids. The $cos(2\pi F_c t)$ and $sin(2\pi F_c t)$ sinusoids are the carrier-frequency (for the pluto_msk this an IF). The more interesting sinusoids are the $cos\Big(\frac{2\pi F_b t}{4}\Big)$ and $sin\Big(\frac{2\pi F_b t}{4}\Big)$ which represent a sinusoid at $\frac{1}{4}$ the bit-rate. The I(t) and Q(t) signals each multiply $\frac{1}{2}$ of their respective sinusoid period by 1 or -1, resulting in 180 degree phase modulated sinusoids as shown below.
