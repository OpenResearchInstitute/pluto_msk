e2a45a7 - Sun Nov 30 23:20:46 2025 -0800 : transmitter stall resolved. had 134 as loop limit when needed 268.
77336cb - Thu Nov 27 18:35:05 2025 -0800 : Prevent Vivado from optimizing away data paths. I think synthesis was tracing through the PRBS mux and determining that the entire TX data path was unused, and then removed the deserializer, the encoder_tdata buses, fifo_tadatoutputs (which gave a no routable loads warning that tipped me off) and tx_data_bit signal. Added do not touch attributes to preserve evertyhing. This may have been the reason we were stalling.
501c991 - Thu Nov 27 16:30:10 2025 -0800 : Revert "Change the encoder to deassert tvalid unconditionally after frame completion. Don't wait for tready." because it did not work in simulation.

6aeaa74 - Sat Nov 8 01:39:25 2025 -0800 : SYNC_TRANSFER_START is asking for a separate external sync signal, not using TLAST as a trigger. TLAST already works automatically with the AXIS DMA. It marks frame boundaries and the DMA respects it without needing any special config. SYNC_TRANSFER_START was erroneously set to TRUE, which overrode the FALSE setting in the ADC DMA block in system_bd.tcl. Once this was fixed, rx_buffer_refill() no longer timed out and data is being seen by the processor side application.

This might be causing the hardware failures we are observing. It did not cause a simulation failure because the result was X, and in simulations, those propagate through the sim and don't stop anything from working.

83b1c67 - Thu Oct 16 18:06:13 2025 -0700 : Add AXI stream frame-based transmission with continuous TVALID flow control. Implements Opulent Voice protcol support with lowest byte extraction from the DMA transfer, implements a dual-clock FIFO to handle clock domain crossing and TLAST for frame boundaries, and prepends the 3 byte sync word. Original parallel to serial converter in msk_top.vhd was replaced. The differential loopback encoder loopback ports were connected. The design was validated in tb_msk_frame_axistream_debug.vhd testbench, with continuous TVALID behavior matching DMA operation, 10 frames tested through the 2048 FIFO, backpressure and flow control validated, and verified zero data loss, proper TREADY toggling when capacity was reached. Waveforms were captured and the FIFO internal state was checked. There are some new files and the system_bd.tcl and ip files were updated. s_axis port names still need to be standardized (s_axis_valid vs s_axis_tvalid), the FIFO is kind of large. It might could be reduced in size. Differential decoder might need some checking. Frame sync word detection on RX side not yet implemented. Tested in simulation and in PLUTO SDR hardware with Dialogus.
